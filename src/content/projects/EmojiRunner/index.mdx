An infinite runner game with Emojis! The goal of this game is to score as many points as possible by avoiding enemies before running out of lives. I conceived the original idea, designed the overall flow of the website, and implemented game sound functionality. This application was built using MySQL, Node, Express, p5.js, Handlebars & Sequelizer.
