I'm Currently studying Fullstack develop at UC Davis Continuing & Professional Education. This is an intensive 24-week long boot camp dedicated to designing and building web applications. In my free time I enjoy being outside and playing video games. I continuously educate myself with new technologies to unleash my creativity as a developer.
